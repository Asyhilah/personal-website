             <center><h3>PRIMARY SCHOOL</h3></center>
             <center><p>At the primary school, I studied at Sekolah Kebangsaan Mahkota Sari, Gerik, Perak for 7 years starting in 2009 until 2015. In 2009, I entered pre-school at this school, then in 2010 I entered standard 1 until standard 6 in 2015. As long as I was in this school, I was in the Maju class which is the first class for each standard. I got 4A1B in the UPSR exam in 2015.</p>
             <p>This achievement is the result of me taking extra classes at night every day held by the teachers of this school. Memories at this school will never be forgotten because the teachers never gave up helping me to become an excellent student.</p>

             <center><h3>SECONDARY SCHOOL</h3></Center>
             <center><p>I studied at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Gerik when I was in form 1 until form 5. The location of my school is not far from home.Throughout my time in secondary school, I have developed a strong interest in the subjects of Mathematics and Bahasa Melayu. I have consistently performed well in my classes and have gotten A's in the subject.</p>
            <p>In extracurricular activities, I held the position of Secretary of the Malay Language Association club and the school's Library club.</p>

             <center><h3>FORM 6</h3></center>
             <center><p>After that, I studied at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Budiman when I was in form 6. The location of my school is quite far from home. I chose a literary stream class that has 4 subjects. During my time at this school, I have been very interested in the subject of General Studies and I got an A in semester 2. In extracurricular activities, I hold the position of treasurer in sports.</p>
            <p>when I was in form 6, I struggled with my friends in completing the course work given by the teacher. Here, I have learned to be a student who is good communication with others and to be a disciplined person by submitting assignments on time.</p>
