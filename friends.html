            <h1>BESTFRIENDS</h1>
            <p>This is my best friend who has been friends for 9 years since 2015. My best friend and I studied in the same school from primary school until secondary school.
                 We always go out together when we have free time and advise each other if we have problems. We have known each other's character and behavior. Therefore, I consider them as my second family.

            <h1>SECONDARY SCHOOL</h1>
            <p>Secondary school is a time of discovery and unforgettable experiences. These were my classmates in form 4 and 5 at SMK Gerik. These memories are of my classmates each brought their own spirit and character while living life as a student.
        </p>
            <p>From class early in the morning until late at night, we both study together to face the SPM exam. They have also helped me if I did not understand a topic in certain subject. We share laughs and celebrate our achievements by going out together.</p>
